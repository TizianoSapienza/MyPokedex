This is a Checklist Pokedex done by using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. 
I took inspiration from a similar Pokedex concept and design I found on Figma and rebuilt it.
Yes, it is very unoptimized and ugly, I know XD.

I also used it to gain confidence and ability on the usage of HTML and especially in CSS styling by creating and experimenting with it.

In the main page I managed to create the checklist by adding custom checkboxes for each pokemon and saving their status in localStorage. 
Also added some filters for Caught/Uncaught pokemons (I need to tweak the search functionalities to work with these 2 filters activated).

In the details page I adjusted some styles and added a button to toggle shiny sprites.
