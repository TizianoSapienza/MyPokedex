This is a Checklist Pokedex using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I took inspiration from a similar project and managed to rebuild it, and then refactor using an OOP approach where I though it would fit better.

I also used it to gain confidence and ability on the usage of HTML and especially in CSS styling by creating and experimenting with it.

The goal is to perfect it and then maybe rebuild it using React/Tailwind or Angular/Material.
